# 🎫 Coldplay Ticket Booking Bot

An automated Node.js bot built using Puppeteer to successfully book Coldplay concert tickets in India. The bot automatically refreshes the ticket booking page, detects when the "Book" button becomes available, and completes the booking process with minimal input.

## 🚀 Features

- **Auto Page Refresh**: Continuously refreshes the page until the "Book" button is clickable.
- **Session Management**: Maintains login state to avoid timeouts.
- **Dynamic Ticket Selection**: Automatically selects the desired tickets and fills out booking details.
- **Error Handling**: Manages errors gracefully during the booking process.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Logs actions in real-time to monitor bot behavior.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
- **Puppeteer**: Headless browser automation.
- **StealthPlugin**: Ensures bot bypasses bot detection (cloudflare) on websites.
- **Axios**: (Optional) For API requests if needed.
- **FS**: For handling local files (like logging and storing session details).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is for **educational purposes only**. There is no guarantee that this bot will successfully book tickets as many factors can affect the booking process, including dynamic website behavior and anti-bot measures.
